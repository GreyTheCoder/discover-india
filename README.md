How I Made This Tourism India Website
For this project, I created a website called Incredible India to show some of the best tourist places in India and why people should visit them.

What I Used
HTML: This is the main language that structures the webpage. It’s like the skeleton. I used it to create sections like the header, hero section, info cards for places, a quote, and footer.

CSS: This makes everything look good. I used CSS to add colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It also helped me make the site work well on different screen sizes (like mobiles and desktops) using something called media queries.

JavaScript: This adds life to the site. For example, it makes the menu work on small screens by showing a hamburger icon you can click to open or close the menu. It also adds animations so some parts fade in when you scroll down. Plus, there’s a countdown timer that shows how many days are left until India’s Independence Day. I also added a “back to top” button that appears when you scroll down.

How It Works
The header has a logo and navigation links. On small screens, the links hide, and a hamburger icon appears. Clicking it toggles the menu.

The hero section introduces the website with a big headline, some text, a signup button, and a nice image.

Below that, I added cards that show famous places like the Taj Mahal and Kerala Backwaters with pictures and short descriptions.

There’s a quote section to inspire visitors about India’s culture.

At the bottom, there’s a call to action encouraging visitors to sign up for more info.

The countdown timer updates every second and counts down to August 15, 2025.
